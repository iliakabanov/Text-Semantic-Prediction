# Text-Semantic-Prediction
In ths task we have to predict text semantic: whether phone review is positive or negative. 
Steps undertaken:
* Cleaning datasets from wrong untyped lines, lowering words
* Skipping stop words
* Lemmatization
* tf-idf implemantion to count weight of each word in a sentence
* word2vec embedding
* hyperparameter tuning through croos-validation
* logistic regression implemention

Conclusion: Obtained results are rather solid, but may pe improved with transformer neural network.
